# Solidity Introduction course workbook English version
Is very helpful for the students to have this valuable course in Spanish, but there is a lot of students, taking this course, thinking in work with an international company, normally in English.

This repository was thought as a complement for Platzi students taking the Solidity Introduction course.

It contains the concepts and samples of my learning of the Platzi's Solidity Introduction course.
